                Paddle for success, paddle to gain momentum, paddle for ecstasy, paddle to encompass the beauty-
                Paddling has a new definition in India when it comes to mountain biking. Cycling alias mountain biking
                tours has always been a favourite sport of many of us. It allows us to move free in the air, increases
                our concentration level and teaches us to take crucial steps especially in the case of crisis. It is a
                kind of adventure sport which takes a lot of sweat and effort to reach the desirable destination. This
                jaggy yet bumpy ride that is nothing less than a staple for the adventurers can be best experienced on
                India's rough roads. Mountain biking is part of adventure tourism that has been running with full force

                <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">

                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
                harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the
                suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.

                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
                kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.
                By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a
                few thousand metres.
                <br><br>
                Air Based: Paragliding, Powered Hang gliding, Parasailing, Sky Diving/Parachuting and Hot Air Ballooning.
                Paragliding: Bir Billing, Manali and Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh, Pune and Nashik in Maharashtra, Vagamon in Kerala, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.
